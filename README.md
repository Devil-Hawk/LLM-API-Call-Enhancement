3. Run the following command to preprocess your dataset:
After running the script, `preprocessed_data.csv` will be generated in your project directory.

### Step 2: Configure API Key
1. Navigate to the `prediction/improvedchatgpt/Improvedv2` directory.
2. Open the file where you need to insert your OpenAI API key.
3. Replace the placeholder in the file with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Step 3: Run Prediction Scripts
1. From the project directory, choose any one of the scripts within the `prediction/improvedchatgpt/Improvedv2` directory to run.
